# Hyrule Castle Market

This project is part of the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-shopping-cart)'s Javascript curriculum.

## Description
### What is Hyrule Castle Market?
Hyrule Castle Market is an e-commerce store modeled after a market from the game Legend of Zelda:Ocarina of Time.

### Why did I build this project?
An E-Commerce store is the final project in the React section of The Odin Project's Javascript Course. I thought it would be fun to make something from a video game series that I love than something like a clothes or toy store.

### My Learning Experience
This project was built so I could learn React Router. React Router is used to set up all the routes for the different rendered pages of the site. I endured several pain points not related to React Router while building the project. One particular difficulty was with how props are passed between nested children. Props are passed several children deep in the component tree. While this is completely functional, it was difficult to manage mentally at first. To solve this issue, I drew a diagram of a tree with each node representing a component and inside that component node I wrote down all the data that it needed to contain in order to function.
